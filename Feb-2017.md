Today I read about using keras pretrained NN models for fitting it to a new dataset with similar requirements. So, there was a competetion to classify different species of fishes. I can simply download the VGGnet now and train only last few layers after making necessary modifications to the output layer(i.e. numer of output categories/nodes). The prior layers generally calculate more general features like, existence of a sharp object so ewhere in th pic or a red lip like structure etc. So, these features will be quite general so that we can train the NN with these features and get much better result than training a complete clueless net.
